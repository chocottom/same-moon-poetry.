    "content": "Here we are again, charged, full of emotions, and above all—gratitude to Allah. I am blessed, alhamdulillah. I sit on my balcony, the sky stretched like a painting: light above, fiery orange below, mountains fading in the distance. But the moon— cut in half, grabs all my attention. And I whisper to myself: \"How did I miss all this beauty, all this glory in front of me?\" Thanks to someone— who inspired me, not with words, but with action, I found a new me. Wallahi, this brings me peace. I was inspired. Inspired by how they look at the sky differently, inspired by their passion for reading. At first, it felt strange— but soon, I was drawn in. Book by book, page by page: from The 48 Laws of Power, to The Psychology of Money, from Ego is the Enemy, to In Our Stories We Live. Each one a step, each one a mirror. And above all, strengthening my bond with Allah turned me into someone new. Now as I write, night has arrived— stars scattered in the distance, and the moon, magnificent, still watching over me. But at least we are watching the same moon.",

    "content": "I wake up and the sun is already smiling birds doing their thing outside coffee in my hand, no rush in my step and I wonder— why do we make life harder than it is Why stress about tomorrow when today is sitting right here singing its simple song isn't this enough the breath in my chest the laugh waiting with my friends the small wins nobody claps for but me I used to think happiness was a place something I had to chase but maybe it's just this a quiet Tuesday with nothing but peace.",

The question is: which challenges are worth facing? Which hard will build you? Which hard will break you? Choose wisely. Choose intentionally. Choose the hard that leads somewhere.",

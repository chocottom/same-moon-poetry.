I need you to redesign the color palette for a poetry website section. Here's what I want:

CURRENT PROBLEM:
- Background: Too dark/brown, feels heavy and not elegant
- Text: Poor contrast, doesn't feel natural or premium
- Cards: Heavy appearance, needs to feel lighter and fresher
- Overall vibe: Feels off and not pleasant to read

DESIRED OUTCOME:
Create 3 complete, distinct color palette variations for a poetry writing website that feel:
- Clean and peaceful
- Elegant but not too serious
- Aesthetic writing website vibe
- Easy on the eyes for reading

FOR EACH PALETTE, PROVIDE:
1. Background color (hex code) - with reasoning why it works
2. Text color (hex code) - with reasoning for readability and harmony
3. Card/highlight background (hex code) - fresher, lighter feel
4. Card border color (hex code) - subtle but defined
5. Accent/highlight color (hex code) - for tags, buttons, section headers
6. Muted text color (hex code) - for secondary text
7. Detailed explanation of why each color works together
8. The mood/feeling the palette creates

ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
- All hex codes must be realistic and production-ready
- Explain color psychology for each palette
- Suggest font recommendations (typefaces, weights, line-height)
- Include a visual preview if possible (React component preferred)
- Make the palettes interactive so I can switch between them to compare

REFERENCE CONTEXT:
- Website type: Literary, reflective poetry platform
- Current colors to avoid: Muddy browns, harsh darks, low contrast
- Target aesthetic: Modern minimalist meets literary elegance
- Content example: Poetry entries with titles, philosophy sections, and story narratives

BONUS:
- Suggest 2-3 font pairing combinations
- Recommend line-height and letter-spacing for optimal readability
- Explain which palette works best for long-form reading
